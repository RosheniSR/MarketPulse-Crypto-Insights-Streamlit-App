# MarketPulse-Crypto-Insights-Streamlit-App
Real-time crypto insights dashboard using Streamlit and Binance API
Overview
This project is a Streamlit web application that provides real-time cryptocurrency insights, price trends, and news, enhanced by a local Large Language Model (LLM). The app allows users to select a cryptocurrency, view its current price, see recent news, visualize price trends, and ask market-related questions to an AI assistant.

Key Features
Cryptocurrency Selection
Users can choose from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin, or Solana via a dropdown menu.
Live Price Display
The app fetches the current price of the selected cryptocurrency using the CoinGecko API.
The price is displayed prominently with a metric widget.
Latest News
The app retrieves the latest news headlines related to the selected cryptocurrency using the CryptoPanic API.
News items are listed for quick reading.
7-Day Price Trend Visualization
The app generates a 7-day price trend plot for the selected cryptocurrency.
Currently, this uses simulated data based on the current price (for demonstration), but can be extended to use real historical data.
AI-Powered Market Insights
Users can enter a question about the market.
The app uses a local LLM (CapybaraHermes 2.5 Mistral 7B) to generate a concise, context-aware answer, incorporating the latest price and news.
User Interface
Built with Streamlit for an interactive, modern web experience.
Includes clear sections for price, news, AI insights, and trend visualization.
Technical Stack
Frontend/UI: Streamlit
Data Fetching: requests library for API calls (CoinGecko, CryptoPanic)
Data Processing: pandas for data manipulation
Plotting: matplotlib for price trend visualization
AI/LLM: llama.cpp via the llama_cpp Python package, running a local GGUF model
Other: datetime for date handling, io.BytesIO for image streaming
How It Works
User selects a cryptocurrency.
App fetches and displays:
Current price (from CoinGecko)
Latest news (from CryptoPanic)
7-day price trend (simulated)
User can ask a question about the market.
The app sends the question, current price, and news context to the local LLM.
The LLM generates and displays a concise financial insight.
Customization & Extensibility
Historical Data: The price trend plot currently uses simulated data. You can enhance it by fetching real historical prices from CoinGecko’s /coins/{id}/market_chart endpoint.
News Filtering: News can be filtered or expanded to include more sources or types.
Model: You can swap the LLM model for another GGUF-compatible model as needed.
UI: Streamlit components can be extended for richer interactivity.
Typical Use Cases
Crypto enthusiasts seeking quick insights and news.
Traders wanting to ask AI-driven questions about market trends.
Developers exploring LLM integration with financial data.
